# Genetic Algorithm for Curve Fitting

This repository implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) designed to fit polynomials to various datasets. The project simulates evolution to find optimal polynomial coefficients that minimize the error between the predicted and actual data points.

## Features

- **Polynomial Fitting**: Supports fitting constants, quadratic, cubic, and other polynomials.
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Easy-to-define functions for specific use cases.
- **Genetic Operations**: Includes selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism.
- **Visualization**: Plots fitness over generations for performance tracking.
- **Flexible Parameters**: Configurable population size, mutation rate, and number of generations.
